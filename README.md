# Spring basics
Basic assignments for Spring Boot introduction week.

## Task 1 – PathVariable
* Create an endpoint that accepts a name via the URL.
* Return a message that greets the user with that name.
* Test in the browser with different names in the URL.

## Task 2 – RequestParam
* Create an endpoint that accepts two numbers as parameters.
* Calculate the product of the numbers and return the result.
* Add a default value for one of the parameters if it is not submitted.

## Task 3 – POST with JSON
* Create an endpoint that accepts an object in JSON format via a POST request.
Return a message that contains the information from the object.
* Test sending different JSON data in Postman.

## Task 4 – List in memory
* Create an endpoint that accepts objects and saves them in a list in memory.
* Create another endpoint that returns the entire list.
* Test by adding multiple objects and retrieving them all.

## Task 5 – Retrieve objects by ID
* Create an endpoint that accepts an ID as part of the URL.
* Have the endpoint search the list for the object with that ID.
